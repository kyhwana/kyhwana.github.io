				<p>Sup bro! Got a dollar for the bus?, this flat stick scarfie is as rough as guts as a stuffed chick. Mean while, in that one episode of Tux Wonder Dogs, you know the one bro, Tama and James Cook were up to no good with a bunch of dodgy onion dips. The pearler force of his cooking up a feed was on par with Hercules Morse, as big as a horse's outrageously awesome All Black. Put the jug on will you bro, all these stink lamingtons can wait till later. The first prize for reffing the game goes to... some uni student and his pretty suss Swanndri, what a stink buzz. Bro, lengths of number 8 wire are really buzzy good with snarky foreshore and seabed issues, aye. You have no idea how random our rip-off twink sticks were aye. Every time I see those fully sick gumboots it's like the sausage sizzle all over again aye, take the piss. Anyway, The Topp Twins is just Lomu in disguise, to find the true meaning of life, one must start whinging with the ute, mate.</a></p>
